## WORK IN PROGRESS
Simple set up for updating a Agenda.md file which will add your google calendar events for the next two days to the top of the file.
Before using you need to first install and follow the relevant set up steps to use https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli and you should have a working python install
Personal set up edits the Agenda.md file in the root folder of my obsidian (https://obsidian.md/) vault
Maybe I'll add some support to change this file path who knows or just edit it yourself in the source code after pulling the repo.
